### Description

This project is a **Python** static site generator that converts raw content files (such as `Markdown` and images) to static websites built in **HTML** and **CSS**.

### Motivation

I wanted to create a [personal website](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~qhoang/) that hosts my portfolio/resume. I thought it would be nice to have everything on a website for ease of access to anyone interested.

> This [website](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~qhoang/) was built using this generator!
