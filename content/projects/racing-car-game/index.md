## Summary

This personal project is a **Python** (version 3.9) game developed using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library. _Try Not To Crash!_ is a survival game in which the player drives a car and avoids falling obstacles. The player can drive the vehicle left or right across the screen to dodge the obstacles falling from the sky!

The game features many elements, including a _main menu_, a _pause menu_, and _different game
modes_. The game modes add to the game's challenge by progressively making the falling blocks
_harder to dodge_!

The game also includes _sound effects_ and _background music_, managed using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)'s mixer module. [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) also manages its graphics, drawing functions, and image-loading capabilities!

The game's code is organized and modular, with separate functions for handling different aspects of the game, such as _drawing the game objects_, _handling user input_, and _managing the game state_. The code also demonstrates [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)'s event-handling
system in response to user actions such as _keyboard inputs_ and _mouse clicks_!

## Motivation

I wanted to build my first project to add to my portfolio in the summer of 2024, so I decided
to create a video game with a GUI (graphical user interface) using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) because I like playing video games, so why not _create one_?

Coding this game was so fun that I finished the project in **three** days!
