This personal project is a **Python** game developed using the **Pygame** library. _Try Not To Crash!_ is a survival game where the player driving a car avoids falling obstacles. The player can drive the vehicle left or right across the screen to dodge the obstacles falling from the sky!

The game features a variety of elements including a _main menu_, a _pause menu_, and _different game modes_. The game modes add to the game's challenge by progressively making the falling blocks _harder to dodge_!

The game also includes _sound effects_ and _background music_, managed using **Pygame**'s mixer module. Its graphics are handled using **Pygame**'s drawing functions and image-loading capabilities!

The game's code is organized and modular, with separate functions for handling different aspects of the game such as _drawing the game objects_, _handling user input_, and _managing the game state_. The code also demonstrates **Pygame**'s event-handling system in response to user actions such as _keyboard inputs_ and _mouse clicks_!
