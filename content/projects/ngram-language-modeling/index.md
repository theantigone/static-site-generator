This project explores **code completion in Java**, leveraging **N-gram language modeling**. The N-gram model predicts the next token in a sequence by learning the _probability distributions of token occurrences_ in training data. The model selects the most probable token based on _learned patterns_, making it a fundamental technique in **natural language processing** and software engineering automation.
