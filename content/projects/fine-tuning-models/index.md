This project explores **code completing suitable** `if` **statements in Python functions**, leveraging [CodeT5 Transformer model from Hugging Face (small-sized model)](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/codet5-small). CodeT5 is a pre-trained encoder-decoder Transformer model designed for code understanding and generation. It has been trained on a large corpus of code across multiple programming languages and supports a range of downstream tasks such as _code completion_, _summarization_, _translation_, and _generation_.
