Initially intended for in-person meetings, my teammates and I introduced necessary variations to <b>support offline, asynchronous discussions</b> (this website).</p><p>This is a <b>React</b> website written in <b>TypeScript</b> built with <b>Vite</b>. The backend is <b>Express</b> and also uses TypeScript. Packages and dependencies are managed with <b>npm</b>. In order to develop and deploy this website you will need to have installed npm on your system. Deployments for the project are hosted on <b>Render</b>.</p><blockquote>You may have to give it some time to load, depending on how recent the website was loaded.</blockquote><p><a href="https://roberts-rules-online.onrender.com/">See Live</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/immacdonald/roberts-rules-online">Source Code</a></p></div></article>
