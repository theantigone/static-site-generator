The player can drive the vehicle left or right across the screen to dodge the obstacles falling from the sky!</p><p>The game features many elements, including a <i>main menu</i>, a <i>pause menu</i>, and <i>different game modes</i>. The game modes add to the game's challenge by progressively making the falling blocks <i>harder to dodge</i>!</p><p>The game also includes <i>sound effects</i> and <i>background music</i>, managed using <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a>'s mixer module. <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> also manages its graphics, drawing functions, and image-loading capabilities!</p><p>The game's code is organized and modular, with separate functions for handling different aspects of the game, such as <i>drawing the game objects</i>, <i>handling user input</i>, and <i>managing the game state</i>. The code also demonstrates <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a>'s event-handling system in response to user actions such as <i>keyboard inputs</i> and <i>mouse clicks</i>!</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>I wanted to build my first project to add to my portfolio in the summer of 2024, so I decided to create a video game with a GUI (graphical user interface) using <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> because I like playing video games, so why not <i>create one</i>?</p><p>Coding this game was so fun that I finished the project in <b>three</b> days!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/theantigone/try-not-to-crash">Source Code</a></p></div></article>
