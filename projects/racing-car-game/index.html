The player can drive the vehicle left or right across the screen to dodge the obstacles falling from the sky!</p><p>The game features a variety of elements including a <i>main menu</i>, a <i>pause menu</i>, and <i>different game modes</i>. The game modes add to the game's challenge by progressively making the falling blocks <i>harder to dodge</i>!</p><p>The game also includes <i>sound effects</i> and <i>background music</i>, managed using <b>Pygame</b>'s mixer module. Its graphics are handled using <b>Pygame</b>'s drawing functions and image-loading capabilities!</p><p>The game's code is organized and modular, with separate functions for handling different aspects of the game such as <i>drawing the game objects</i>, <i>handling user input</i>, and <i>managing the game state</i>. The code also demonstrates <b>Pygame</b>'s event-handling system in response to user actions such as <i>keyboard inputs</i> and <i>mouse clicks</i>!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/theantigone/Car-Pygame">Source Code</a></p></div></article>
