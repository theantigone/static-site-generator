[^1]: A sample page generated by my **static site generator**.

### Description

This project is a **Python** static site generator that converts raw content files (such as `Markdown` and images) to static websites built in **HTML** and **CSS**.

### Motivation

I wanted to create a [**personal website**](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~qhoang/) that hosts my portfolio/resume. I thought it would be nice to have everything on a website for ease of access to anyone interested.

### How to run the website (server) locally

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theantigone/static-site-generator.git
```
2. Inside the project, change the current working directory to the `public` directory, and use Python's built-in [HTTP server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#command-line-interface) to serve the contents of the `public` directory:
```bash
cd public
python3 -m http.server 8888
```
3. Open the browser, and paste in the URL of your server ([`http://localhost:8888/`](http://localhost:8888/) if you used port `8888` as suggested in the code snippet above) into the address bar.
4. You should now see the files rendered as a web page(s)!

> [!NOTE]
> _You can kill the server with `Ctrl+C`. To restart it, simply type in:_
> ```bash
> python3 -m http.server 8888
> ```

### ü§ù Contributing

1. Clone the repo (unless you already did), then play around with the `src` files
2. Run tests to ensure your code is robust:
```bash
./test.sh
```
3. Build the project to see live results:
```bash
./build.sh
python3 -m http.server 8888
```
4. Submit a pull request!
    - If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and open a pull request to the `master` branch.
